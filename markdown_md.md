_TeX is a typesetting system (or a “formatting system”) which was designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978._ TeX is popular in academia, especially in mathematics, computer science, economics, engineering, linguistics, physics, statistics, and quantitative psychology. **It has largely displaced Unix troff, the other favored formatting system, in many Unix installations which use both for different purposes.** It is also used for many other typesetting tasks, especially in the form of LaTeX, ConTeXt, and other macro packages.”.
